1. properties_10597.csv is the report of issue CAMEL-10597.
2. Q2_Solution: --While testing-- There is no '#' on the board. Enter '#' to exit.
3. Q3_Solution: Comments on the page are dynamically rendered, thus we won't be able to directly retrieve it without rendering the pages. The rendering process was super slow, so I choose to use Jira API as a more lightweight solution.
4. Note that some issue reportsï¼ˆe.g. CAMEL-10630) require permissions to access.
5. Due to time constraints and poor network conditions, I only crawled and parsed issue reports 10000-13596.
