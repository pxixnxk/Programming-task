1. properties_10597.csv is the report of issue CAMEL-10597
2. Q2_Solution: There is no '#' on the board. Enter '#' to exit.
3. Q3_Solution: Comments on the page are dynamically rendered, thus we won't be able to directly retrieve it without rendering the pages. The rendering process was super slow, so I choose to use Jira API as a more lightweight solution.
