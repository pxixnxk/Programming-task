rest(""/test"").get().type(ClassA.class).to(""direct:someRoute""); rest(""/testSub"").get().type(ClassB.class).to(""direct:someOtherRoute"");
And in the type ClassA contains a reference to ClassB.
Within the Swagger Doc the path for ClassA renders as expected:
/test: get: responses: 200: schema: $ref: '#/definitions/ClassA'
However ClassB gets a string parameter scheme
/testSub: get: responses: 200: schema: type : 'string' format : 'com.ClassB'
However I'd expect it to be:
/testSub: get: responses: 200: schema: $ref: '#/definitions/ClassB'","ASF GitHub Bot:2016-12-14T14:55:56.581+0000:GitHub user bobpaulin opened a pull request:
